## The Scene
Scene, aka "The Warez Scene", is a collection of gorups that rip and remove copyright protection from games, movies, to software. Scene has some strict rules though to stay secret and ensure safe quality posts. It's a slightly overcomplicated system though I'll explain.

## Who is in The Scene
Let's start by looking at [predb.org](https://predb.org). Upon opening the site you see a bunch of Releases, Sections, Groups, and Age. Let's focus on the group section for now. We have names like GLHF and DARKFLiX.

### Step 1: Scene Rips and Uploads
These scene groups create rips may it be from websites like Disney or Netflix, or ripping from Bluray CDs. The reason these groups are so special is because the software and tools used to do such rips is super fucking secret.

> Note: Scene rips for popularity and credits, not for the user base.

After a member of a scene group makes a release, it gets uploaded to a high-speed [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) server, this is called a topsite. Usually these are university computer systems that have been broken into. Once a release is available on one of these FTP servers, Racers get access (via FXP board usually) and more the files to their own servers at stupidly fast speeds, gigabytes a second sometimes.

        Yes it is, the Racers use a method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_eXchange_Protocol">FXP</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FXP_board">FXP Boards</a> Which uses FTP but forces it to be server-to-server instead to enable super high-bandwidth transfers. These boards are invite-only and not advertised.

### Step 2: Site Channels, Checks, and Racers
All activity is logged into a private [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel via a sitebot. Every release is checked on a site like [predb.org](https://predb.org) to ensure there is no duplicates. Also while checking it's checked to see that it's a good release and not malware.

Shortly after a release is posted Racers will repost the release on as many sites as possible first. If they are not the first their post may be removed are receive less credits.

### Step 3: Credits
This is where you as a reader may be more familiar, the uploaders to sites like 1337x, or private torrent trackers. When a Racer uploads new content, especially fresh from scene, they get points. For example, if they upload a 30gb warez media to a site channel they get a 60gb of download credit in return. This download credit allows the person that uploaded the media to download more media from the site.

### What Types of Site Channels are There?
Just remeber they all share the same goal, to move releases from the scene to a more public zone, usually though this is a private invite-only group that lets people join every once in a while.

#### IRC Trading
As mentioned above, there's some IRC channels/groups that will have a server-to-user or user-to-user system, they're both the same concept operating on [DCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Client-to-Client)/SDCC but server-to-user usually has higher banwidth (via [XDCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDCC)) and faster access to new content.

- user-to-user (DCC/SDCC): Connecting members of a irc-sharing chat to download media from eachother. Usually these IRC channels would use SDCC (Secure DCC) to encrypt the transfers to ensure better security. 

- server-to-user (XDCC): Instead of connecting to a bunch of other people in the same IRC channel, you would run a command and a bot that has access to a server full of content would make a single connection to you. These servers usually have pretty high bandwidth. What makes XDCC different though is that it allows single point transfer of large files by splitting them into smaller chunks (in short).

XDCC is the preferred and more reliable method, and there are also sites to search for XDCC content like [SunXDCC](http://sunxdcc.com/) or [nbil](https://nibl.co.uk/) (anime only).

If the release is popular on a XDCC bot, you'll be queued to ensure you get good download speeds, instead of a bunch of people getting utter shit download speed.

IRC downloading may not always be the best solution due to the lack of older content, but it's much faster for newer content, or available content then BitTorrent.

#### BitTorrent
BitTorrent clients are entirely peer-to-peer which means your speeds depend on how many people have the file(s) and how much bandwidth you can handle. There's private trackers and public trackers, aka indexers.

- Private Trackers: Get posts fresh from Racers first usually and require an invite to join. These sites get new scene releases first.

- Public Trackers: Get scene posts last most of the time, but if you're looking for older media not a bad place to look.

BitTorrent access though is overall very easy to reach, and usually frowned upon by more expirenced pirates since it's pretty insecure and easy for the RIAA/FBI to reach. These indexers/trackers often go down, and the police boast about the amount of pirated content they removed when really they just removed a list, no pirated content was actually deleted directly.
