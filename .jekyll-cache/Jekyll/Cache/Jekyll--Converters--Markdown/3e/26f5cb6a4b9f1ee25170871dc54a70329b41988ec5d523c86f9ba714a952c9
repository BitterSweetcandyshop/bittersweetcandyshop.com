<p>I used to go by the name Crenshaw(1312), now you can find me as BitterSweet(candyshop) on most sites.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of my time reading and programming little scrapers to make life a fair bit easier,is a cog/commands list <a href="https://github.com/BitterSweetcandyshop/BitterSweet-Cogs">BitterSweet-Cogs</a>. This project is a pretty good example of the stuff I do, automation of things in the piracy scene.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>I really like to read manga (r/mangapiracy!!) and work on linux (r/unixporn) ricing.</p>

<p>I do work 8am-5pm (UTC-8 - California) but I’m overall quick to reply. I will assume that you need help since that’s what most people dm me about, please just ask. If I don’t reply to anyone in three days, something is actually really wrong, please reach out to DieDoesMC#0945 on discord.</p>
