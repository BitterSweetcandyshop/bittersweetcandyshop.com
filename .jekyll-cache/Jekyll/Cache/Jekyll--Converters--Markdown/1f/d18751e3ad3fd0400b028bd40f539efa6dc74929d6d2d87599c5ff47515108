<p>I used to go by the name Crenshaw, now you can find me as BitterSweet or BitterSweetcandyshop on most sites.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of my time reading and programming little scrapers to make life a fair bit easier, my most recent project is a cog list <a href="https://github.com/BitterSweetcandyshop/BitterSweet-Cogs">BitterSweet-Cogs</a></p>
