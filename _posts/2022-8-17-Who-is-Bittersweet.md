## Who is BitterSweet?
I used to go by the name Crenshaw(1312), now you can find me as BitterSweet(candyshop) on most sites.

I spend a lot of my time reading and programming little scrapers to make life a fair bit easier,is a cog/commands list [BitterSweet-Cogs](https://github.com/BitterSweetcandyshop/BitterSweet-Cogs). This project is a pretty good example of the stuff I do, automation of things in the piracy scene.

## Hobbies
- Manga reading (Romance (not hentai), Action/Gore)
- Watching 2005-2016s cartoons (Generator Rex, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien)
- Prgramming (duh)
- Reading/Listening to reigous texts and other religion-based audio books.
- Chatting about music and new finds on [Quatroph's musical journey](https://discord.gg/ejsrADZfRZ).

## Contact/Ruh-Rohs
I do work 8am-5pm (UTC-8 - California) but I'm overall quick to reply. I will assume that you need help since that's what most people dm me about, please just ask.

Best to worst, my DMs are always open.
