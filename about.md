## Who is BitterSweet?
I used to go by the name Crenshaw (1312), but now you can find me as BitterSweet (candyshop) or BitterSweet1337 on most sites.

I spend a lot of my time reading and programming little scrapers to make life a bit easier, a cog/commands list is [BitterSweet-Cogs](https://github.com/BitterSweetcandyshop/BitterSweet-Cogs). This project is a pretty good example of the stuff I do, which is automation of things in the piracy scene.

## Hobbies
- Manga reading; Romance, Action/Gore, and Supernatural
- Watching 1930-1970s and 2000-2016s cartoons (Popeye and Generator Rex! Whroo)
- Programming (duh)
- Reading/Listening to religious texts and other religion-based audiobooks.
- Making typos.
- Chatting about music and new finds on [Quatroph's Musical Journey](https://discord.gg/ejsrADZfRZ).

## Contact
I do work 8am-5pm (UTC-8 – California), but I'm overall quick to reply. I will assume that you need help since that's what most people message me about; please just ask.

Best to worst, my DMs are always open.

## Projects as of now
- **CandyLand** A modded Nintendo Switch with Linux to act as both a media server and media client. I want to make use of the docking feature the switch has and the pre-made web portals for *arr apps, so people can make their own in-depth customizations or quick ones with some custom software (Flutter???). I think using Xmonad and making a DE that mocks the original Switch look would be best, though the biggest issue will be the 4GB of RAM the v1 Switch has.

## Why are you like everywhere?
I like to go around to each piracy "type" and learn as much as I can while learning how to truly value that media type.

Here's a list of things I've learned how to value truly and make my own releases:
- **Music** I've done music mostly and working on saving up to get better headphones. I do use Qobuz 24bit lossless. (utter overkill)
- **Anime/TV** Still very new, learning about how releases are made and some more niche topics like how debanding works.
- **Manga** Learning about De-DRM and hoping to eventually make my own releases. I'm working on a collection of good rippers and scanlation groups to make pages for on this site!
- **Audiobooks** Not started, but I do love “Letter to a Christian Nation” by Sam Harris
- **Movies** Basically the same as TV, but I haven't started yet.
- **Software** Not going to, I have minimal interest.
- **Games** I've chatted a lot with repackers and plan on making pages for them. I like and leave reviews, however.
- **Emulation** Haven't started.

*I may not know the back-end to making my own releases for everything, but I do know how to find and whom to talk to for most piracy content.*
