## Who is BitterSweet?
I used to go by the name Crenshaw(1312), now you can find me as BitterSweet(candyshop) or BitterSweet1337 on most sites.

I spend a lot of my time reading and programming little scrapers to make life a fair bit easier,is a cog/commands list [BitterSweet-Cogs](https://github.com/BitterSweetcandyshop/BitterSweet-Cogs). This project is a pretty good example of the stuff I do, automation of things in the piracy scene.

## Hobbies
- Manga reading; Romance, Action/Gore, and Supernatural
- Watching 1930-1970s and 2000-2016s cartoons (Popeye and Generator Rex! whroo)
- Prgramming (duh)
- Reading/Listening to religous texts and other religion-based audio books.
- Making typos.
- Chatting about music and new finds on [Quatroph's musical journey](https://discord.gg/ejsrADZfRZ).

## Contact
I do work 8am-5pm (UTC-8 - California) but I'm overall quick to reply. I will assume that you need help since that's what most people dm me about, please just ask.

Best to worst, my DMs are always open.

## Projects as of now
- **Bit** Just my bot that's hosted that makes use of *all* the cogs/commands on my [BitterSweet-Cogs](https://github.com/BitterSweetcandyshop/BitterSweet-Cogs) cog list. If you would like the bot shoot me a dm.
- **Everyone's CandyShop** A collection of backends and cli tools to search for media on database sites like anilist and imdb etc for as many media types as possible.

## Why are you like everywhere?
I like to go around to each piracy "type" and learn as much as I can while learning how to truely value that media type.

Here's a list of things I've learned how to value truely and make my own releases:
- **Music** I've done music mostly and working on saving up to get better headphones and I do use qobuz 24bit lossless. (utter overkill)
- **Anime/TV** Still very new, learning about how releases are made and some more niche topics like how debanding works.
- **Manga** Learning about DeDRM and hoping to eventually make my own releases. I'm working on a collection of good rippers and scanlation groups to make pages for on this site!
- **Audiobooks** Not started, but I do love "Letter to a Christian Nation" by Sam Harris
- **Movies** Basically the same as tv, but not started
- **Software** Not going to, I have minimal interest
- **Games** I've chatted a lot with repackers and plan on making pages for repackers I like and reviews although.
- **Emulation** Haven't started.

*I may not know the back-end to making my own releases for everything, but I do know how to find and whom to talk to for most piracy content*
